## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide 🛠️

Follow these instructions carefully to ensure your bot is configured correctly. 👍

### Step 1: API Key Configuration & Environment Setup 🔑⚙️

Your bot needs API keys to connect to Binance and the AI analysis service (Gemini). These keys are sensitive and should be kept secure. We'll store them in a `.env` file, which helps keep them separate from the main codebase. 🤫

1.  **Obtain Your API Keys:**
    * **Binance API Key:**
        * Log in to your [Binance account](https://www.binance.com) Login.
        * Navigate to "API Management" (usually under your profile icon 👤).
        * Create a new API key.
        * **❗ Important: ❗**
            * Enable "Futures Trading" permissions. ✅
            * For security, **do NOT enable "Withdrawals"** ❌.
            * It's highly recommended to restrict API key access to trusted IPs if possible. 🛡️
        * Copy your `API Key` and `Secret Key` immediately. The Secret Key is only shown once! 📝
    * **Gemini API Key:**
        * You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud for accessing Gemini models.
        * Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) 🌌 (or your Google Cloud Console if using Vertex AI).
        * Create a new API key.
        * Copy your `API Key`. 📝

2.  **Create the `.env` File:**
    * In the main directory where you've placed the bot files 📁, create a new file named exactly `.env` (note the dot at the beginning).
    * Open this `.env` file with a text editor ✍️.
    * Add your API keys in the following format, replacing `YOUR_..._KEY` with your actual keys:

        ```plaintext
        BINANCE_API_KEY=YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY
        BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_BINANCE_SECRET_KEY
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```

    * Save and close the `.env` file. **Never share this file or commit it to public repositories!** 🤐

### Step 2: Install the Trading Bot 📥💻

Now that your API keys are set up, you need to install the bot and its dependencies.

1.  **Open Your Command Line/Terminal:**
    * On Windows, you can use Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell.
    * On macOS or Linux, use Terminal.

2.  **Navigate to the Bot's Directory:**
    * Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the bot files. For example:
        ```bash
        cd path/to/your/trading_bot_directory
        ```

3.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    * We've provided a simple command to install all necessary components. Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```bash
        install_trading_bot
        ```
        *(Note: If `install_trading_bot` is a custom script you provide, ensure it handles Python environment setup (like `venv`) and `pip install -r requirements.txt` if applicable. If it's a placeholder for a more specific command like `pip install .` or `python setup.py install`, adjust this instruction accordingly.)*

    * This command will download and install all the required libraries and packages for the bot to function. Please be patient ਧੀਰਜ, as this might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection. 🌐⏳
    * Look out for any error messages during the installation. If you encounter issues, ensure you have Python and pip correctly installed and added to your system's PATH. 🔍

### Step 3: Run the Trading Bot! ▶️💨

With everything installed and configured, you're ready to launch your trading bot!

1.  **Ensure you are still in the bot's directory** in your command line/terminal.
2.  **Execute the Run Script:**
    * Simply run the provided batch file by typing:
        ```bash
        run_trading_bot.bat
        ```
    * This will start the bot. You should see a menu or interface appear in your terminal. ✨

3.  **Using the Bot:**
    * The bot will present you with a menu. 📜
    * You can typically:
        * Select a trading strategy. 🧭
        * View current market analysis and trade suggestions. 🧐
        * Configure other settings as available. ⚙️
    * Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with your bot.
